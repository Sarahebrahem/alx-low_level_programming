Learning File I/O

Creating, opening, closing, reading, and writing files are fundamental operations in computer programming. Here are the basic concepts and steps involved in these operations:

Creating a file: To create a file, you can use the open() system call with the O_CREAT flag. This system call returns a file descriptor, which is an integer representing the file.

Opening a file: To open an existing file, you can use the open() system call with the O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, or O_RDWR flag, depending on whether you want to read, write, or both read and write to the file. This system call also returns a file descriptor.

Closing a file: When you're done using a file, you should close it using the close() system call. This releases the file descriptor associated with the file and frees up system resources.

Reading from a file: To read from a file, you can use the read() system call, which takes the file descriptor, a buffer to store the data, and the number of bytes to read as parameters. This system call returns the number of bytes read.

Writing to a file: To write to a file, you can use the write() system call, which takes the file descriptor, a buffer containing the data to write, and the number of bytes to write as parameters. This system call returns the number of bytes written.

File descriptors are integer values that the operating system uses to identify and manage open files. They provide a way to access files and perform I/O operations on them.

The three standard file descriptors are:

STDIN_FILENO (0): This file descriptor represents standard input, which is typically the keyboard or another input device.

STDOUT_FILENO (1): This file descriptor represents standard output, which is typically the screen or another output device.

STDERR_FILENO (2): This file descriptor represents standard error, which is typically used for error messages or diagnostic output.

The POSIX names for these file descriptors are STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO, and STDERR_FILENO.

The flags O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, and O_RDWR are used with the open() system call to specify the mode in which to open a file. O_RDONLY indicates that the file should be opened for reading only, O_WRONLY indicates that the file should be opened for writing only, and O_RDWR indicates that the file should be opened for both reading and writing.

File permissions determine who can access a file and what actions they can perform on it. When creating a file with the open() system call, you can set the file permissions using the third argument, which is an integer representing the permissions. You can use the chmod() system call to change file permissions after the file has been created.

A system call is a request made by a program to the operating system kernel for a specific service or resource. Examples of system calls include opening and closing files, creating processes, and allocating memory.

A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. A system call is a function provided by the operating system that allows a program to access system resources. The main difference between a function and a system call is that a function is executed within the program's address space, while a system call requires a context switch to the kernel's address space.
